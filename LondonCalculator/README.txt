This is not strictly related with my LMAX experiments, as it is a simple applet I wrote at some point to refresh my knowledge of Java.

Moving the slider, the user can change the gross salary, and the applet will update in real time the net monthyl pay and deducting the amount of money that I was willing to pay in order to rent a family home in London.
