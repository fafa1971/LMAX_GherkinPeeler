# LMAX GherkinPeeler

These are a couple of very simple Forex scalpers I wrote in Java back in 2012-2013 for the LMAX (London Multi-Asset eXchange, www.lmax.com).

Neeedless to say, they did not work, or I would be rich and I would not be sharing them here.  ;-)

They are both self-contained in the GherkinPeeler.java file, inside the com/lmax/gherkin subdirectory; all the other files are the same.

The first one (in the "v1" directory) was based on a triangle of currencies, e.g. if two of GBPEUR and EURUSD move, then also USDGBP should be going to move accordingly.

The second one (in the "v2" directory) was based on the detection of a trend, aka candlesticks.

Enjoy!!!
